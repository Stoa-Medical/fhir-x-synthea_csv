# Condition

## Semantic Context
The Condition resource represents a clinical condition, problem, or diagnosis. This mapping transforms Synthea CSV condition data into FHIR R4 Condition resources, preserving the clinical semantics of diagnoses and their temporal relationships.

## Field Mappings
| Source Field | Target Field | Semantic Concept | Transform | Semantic Notes |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| conditions.START | Condition.onsetDateTime | Onset Date/Time | Format as ISO 8601 | When condition started |
| conditions.STOP | Condition.abatementDateTime | Abatement Date/Time | Format as ISO 8601 | When condition resolved (if applicable) |
| conditions.PATIENT | Condition.subject | Patient Reference | Create Reference("Patient/{id}") | Patient with condition |
| conditions.ENCOUNTER | Condition.encounter | Encounter Reference | Create Reference("Encounter/{id}") | Encounter where diagnosed |
| conditions.CODE | Condition.code.coding[0].code | SNOMED Code | Direct copy | SNOMED CT code |
| conditions.DESCRIPTION | Condition.code.coding[0].display | Code Display | Direct copy | Human-readable description |
| conditions.CODE | Condition.code.coding[0].system | Code System | Set to "http://snomed.info/sct" | SNOMED CT system |
| conditions.DESCRIPTION | Condition.code.text | Code Text | Direct copy | Fallback text description |
| - | Condition.clinicalStatus | Clinical Status | Determine from STOP field | active or resolved |
| - | Condition.verificationStatus | Verification Status | Set to "confirmed" | All CSV conditions are confirmed |
| - | Condition.category | Condition Category | Set to "encounter-diagnosis" | Default category |
| - | Condition.id | Resource ID | Generate from PATIENT+START+CODE | Composite key |

## Clinical Status Logic
```
if STOP is null or empty:
    clinicalStatus = {
        "coding": [{
            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-clinical",
            "code": "active",
            "display": "Active"
        }]
    }
else:
    clinicalStatus = {
        "coding": [{
            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-clinical",
            "code": "resolved",
            "display": "Resolved"
        }]
    }
```

## Verification Status
All conditions from Synthea CSV are considered confirmed:
```json
{
    "coding": [{
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-ver-status",
        "code": "confirmed",
        "display": "Confirmed"
    }]
}
```

## Category Mapping
Default to encounter-diagnosis for all conditions:
```json
[{
    "coding": [{
        "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/condition-category",
        "code": "encounter-diagnosis",
        "display": "Encounter Diagnosis"
    }]
}]
```

## Semantic Rules and Constraints
- SNOMED CT codes are preserved from Synthea (primary terminology for conditions)
- Clinical status is derived from presence/absence of STOP date
- All conditions are marked as confirmed (Synthea doesn't generate unconfirmed diagnoses)
- Onset is always present (START field required)
- Abatement only present if condition has resolved (STOP field present)
- Subject (patient) reference is required
- Encounter reference links to the diagnostic encounter

## Implementation Notes
- Function: `fhir_x_synthea_csv.to_fhir.condition.condition_mapper`
- Preserves SNOMED CT coding from Synthea
- Automatic clinical status determination
- Handles both active and resolved conditions
- Uses common transformers for datetime formatting
- Generates stable IDs for resource references
