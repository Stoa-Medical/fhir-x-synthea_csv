# Immunization

## Semantic Context
This mapping transforms Synthea `immunizations.csv` rows (patient immunization administrations) into FHIR R4 `Immunization` resources. The resource is categorized under Clinical/Pharmacy (FHIR Maturity Level: 5). The `Patient` it references is Normative.

## Field Mappings
| Source Field | Target Field | Semantic Concept | Transform | Semantic Notes |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|
| immunizations.DATE | Immunization.occurrenceDateTime | Administration Date/Time | Format as ISO 8601 | When the immunization was administered |
| immunizations.PATIENT | Immunization.patient | Patient Reference | Create Reference("Patient/{id}") | Recipient patient |
| immunizations.ENCOUNTER | Immunization.encounter | Encounter Reference | Create Reference("Encounter/{id}") | Encounter where administered |
| immunizations.CODE | Immunization.vaccineCode.coding[0].code | CVX Code | Direct copy | Vaccine administered |
| immunizations.DESCRIPTION | Immunization.vaccineCode.coding[0].display | Code Display | Direct copy | Human-readable vaccine description |
| immunizations.CODE | Immunization.vaccineCode.coding[0].system | Code System | Set to "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/cvx" | CVX code system URI |
| immunizations.DESCRIPTION | Immunization.vaccineCode.text | Code Text | Direct copy | Fallback text |
| immunizations.COST | Immunization.extension[url=`http://synthea.mitre.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/immunization-cost`].valueDecimal | Line Item Cost | Copy as decimal | Not part of core; preserved via extension |
| - | Immunization.status | Administration Status | Set to "completed" | Synthea exports administered immunizations |
| - | Immunization.id | Resource ID | Generate from DATE+PATIENT+CODE | Composite key |

## Notes on Financial Data
Cost is not part of the core `Immunization` resource. It is most appropriately modeled in financial resources such as `Claim` or `ExplanationOfBenefit` (Maturity Level: 2). This mapping preserves `COST` using a simple extension at `http://synthea.mitre.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/immunization-cost` with `valueDecimal`. Downstream systems may alternatively materialize financial resources.

## Semantic Rules and Constraints
- CVX codes from Synthea are preserved in `vaccineCode`.
- `status` is set to `completed` for administered immunizations.
- `occurrenceDateTime` is required and formatted as ISO 8601.
- Patient and Encounter are represented as references.

## Implementation Notes
- Function: `fhir_x_synthea_csv.to_fhir.immunization.map_immunization`
- Uses common transformers for datetime formatting and reference building.
- Generates stable IDs for resource references from composite keys.
