# Organization (organizations.csv â†’ Organization)

## Semantic Context
Synthea `organizations.csv` describes provider organizations (e.g., hospitals). This mapping produces a FHIR R4 `Organization` resource representing the provider entity. Geolocation is modeled via the standard Address geolocation extension; aggregate metrics are preserved via a custom extension for roundtrip fidelity.

## Field Mappings
| Source Field | Target Field | Semantic Concept | Transform | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| organizations.Id | Organization.id | Organization Identity | Direct copy | Primary key (UUID) |
| organizations.Name | Organization.name | Official Name | Direct copy | Required |
| organizations.Address | Organization.address[0].line[0] | Street Address | Direct copy | Required by CSV; optional in FHIR |
| organizations.City | Organization.address[0].city | City | Direct copy |  |
| organizations.State | Organization.address[0].state | State/Province | Direct copy | Optional |
| organizations.Zip | Organization.address[0].postalCode | Postal Code | Direct copy | Optional |
| organizations.Lat | Organization.address[0].extension | Geolocation | Create HL7 geolocation extension | `valueDecimal` latitude |
| organizations.Lon | Organization.address[0].extension | Geolocation | Create HL7 geolocation extension | `valueDecimal` longitude |
| organizations.Phone | Organization.telecom[] | Contact Points | Split into multiple `phone` entries | Split on `, ; / |` and trim |
| organizations.Revenue | Organization.extension[org-stats].extension[revenue] | Aggregate Metric | valueDecimal | Custom extension preserves simulation revenue |
| organizations.Utilization | Organization.extension[org-stats].extension[utilization] | Aggregate Metric | valueInteger | Number of encounters performed |

## Extensions
- Geolocation: `http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/geolocation`
- Organization statistics (custom): `http://synthea.mitre.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/organization-stats`
  - Sub-extensions:
    - `revenue` (valueDecimal)
    - `utilization` (valueInteger)

## Implementation Notes
- Forward function: `fhir_x_synthea_csv.to_fhir.organization.map_organization`
- Address array is included only when at least one component is present.
- Multiple phones are split and each becomes a `telecom` entry with `system="phone"`.
- Numeric parsing is best-effort; unparseable values are skipped from the stats extension.
